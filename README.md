# Phyta
A fully moddable 2D garden-defense engine

Phyta is an open-source framework for building lane-based defense games. Inspired by classic titles like Plants vs. Zombies, Phyta is designed to be mod-friendly and scriptable from the ground up. Completely free from proprietary assets or restrictions.

## Current Status

- **Stage**: Planning & prototyping

**Engine**: Not yet implemented

**Gameplay**: None

**Assets**: None/Prototyping

## Goals

- Provide an open foundation for PvZ-style gameplay.
- Support runtime modding (define entities, projectiles, rules)
- Keep the engine lightweight, readable, and extensible
- Encourage a community-driven ecosystem of mods and forks

## Contributing

Weâ€™re still laying the groundwork.
Ideas, design discussions, and feature suggestions are very welcome.
Code contributions will open once the prototype core is ready.
