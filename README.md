# Phyta
A fully moddable 2D garden-defense engine

Phyta is an open-source framework for building lane-based defense games. Inspired by classic titles like Plants vs. Zombies, Phyta is designed to be mod-friendly and scriptable from the ground up.

## Current Status

- Planning / prototyping phase
- Core engine not yet implemented
- No gameplay or assets yet

## Goal

Create a lightweight, fully moddable engine where anyone can define custom entities, projectiles, levels, and rules via scripts and configs.
